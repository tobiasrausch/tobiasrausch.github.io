Over the past years I had the great opportunity to contribute to a range of research projects. A subset of these is outlined below and a complete list of my co-authored publication is on [Google Scholar][gs].

**Structural Variant Calling in 1000 Genomes**

The [1000 Genomes Project][gp] created a catalogue of human genetic variation. I contributed to the [structural variation call set][sv].

**Cancer Genomics**

Genomics research is expanding at a breathtaking pace. In 2012, I co-authored my very first [Cancer Genomics paper][ce] with only 3 whole-genome sequencing samples. Only 5 years later, we are analyzing 2,800 Cancer Genomes in the [PCAWG study][pc].

**GEAR: Genome Analysis Server**

[Gear][ge] is a Genome Analysis Server with interactive and efficient web applications for molecular biologists.
