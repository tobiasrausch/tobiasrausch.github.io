Setting up this website and blog
---

This website is hosted for free using [GitHubPages](https://pages.github.com/). The [source code](https://github.com/tobiasrausch/tobiasrausch.github.io) requires [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator that makes it really easy to write down your website content in Markdown language. The theme I am using is called [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman).
