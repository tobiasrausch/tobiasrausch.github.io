Hello. I am Tobias Rausch, a bioinformatician working in computational genomics. I'm specialized in structural variant discovery, sequence analysis algorithms and software engineering. I am a passionate programmer and most of my code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tobiasrausch). I work at [EMBL](https://www.embl.de/), a great research institution for molecular biology. I am very thankful for my job and I truly enjoy it every day. More information can be found through [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/tobias-rausch-48659a80).
