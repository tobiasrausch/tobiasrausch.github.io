# Machine learning questions

Below are a set of questions for our machine learning exercises. There is always one correct answer for each question. Thus, please email me the answers as a simple list, i.e. answers: 1.a, 2.b, 3.a, and so on. You are welcome to use, of course, the links provided in the exercises to answer the questions. The [Hundred-Page Machine Learning textbook](http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php) might also be helpful to answer some of the theoretical questions. The chapters can be read online for free, you do not need to buy the book (unless you like it and want a printed copy).

## Questions

1. For the [Breast Cancer data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) we wanted to predict malignant (encoded as 1) versus benign (encoded as 0) from a set of features about each tumor (area, radius, perimeter, ...). The data was labeled with benign (0) and malignant (1) and thus, this is an example of

   a. Supervised Learning

   b. Unsupervised Learning


2. For the testing data of the Breast Cancer data set we assumed we don't know the label (benign/malignant) and thus, we attempted to predict the label using our trained model. Such a problem is called a

   a. Learning problem

   b. Regression problem

   c. Classification problem

3. Which statement is NOT correct about k-Nearest Neighbors

   a. The algorithm can be used for classification

   b. The algorithm looks at close neighbors of the input instance

   c. The algorithm uses an acyclic graph to make a decision about the output label

   d. The algorithm outputs the label for an input instance that occurs most frequently among its neighbors 


4. We have built a classification model that predicts correct labels in our training data set at 95% accuracy. On unseen test data the model predicts the correct label at 70% accuracy. This phenomenon is called

   a. Regression

   b. Overfitting

   c. Underfitting


5. Which statement is NOT correct about decision trees

   a. The algorithm uses in each branching node of the tree a specific feature and threshold to decide if the left or right branch is followed

   b. The leaf nodes decide which class an input instance belongs to

   c. The algorithm uses as many branching nodes as input features

   d. The algorithm uses an acyclic graph to make a decision about the output label


6. We want to predict the blood pressure of a person from a set of input features (age, weight, smoking status, ...). This is an example of a

   a. Binary classification problem

   b. Decision tree problem

   c. Regression problem


7. In a linear regression task the residuals refer to

   a. The difference between the observed values of the outcome (dependent) variable and the predicted values

   b. The sum of the squared errors of the predicted values compared to the true outcome values

   c. The coefficients/weights of the linear regression model


8. Which of the following methods we CANNOT use to compare the quality of different linear regression models

   a. Akaike information criterion

   b. Adjusted R squared

   c. Inter quartile range

   d. Bayesian information criterion


9. The accuracy of a model in terms of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), false negatives (FN) is defined as

   a. TP/(TP+FP)

   b. (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)

   c. FP/(FP+TP)

   d. (2*TP)/(2*TP+FP+FN)


0. The F1 score (F-score) is defined as

   a. TP/(TP+FP)

   b. (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)

   c. FP/(FP+TP)

   d. (2*TP)/(2*TP+FP+FN)
