## Analytical methods in Cancer Genomics

This course will focus on the analysis of data from cancer genomics studies. Bioinformatic concepts, tools and methods required to analyse tumor sequencing data will be introduced. Learning outcomes include an overview of the challenges in the study of cancer genomics, discovery and visualisation of copy-number and structural variants, understanding the principles of tumor purity, heterogeneity and ploidy and an overview of cancer epigenetics. Practical data analysis sessions in R or python and using shell scripts will complement the course.
